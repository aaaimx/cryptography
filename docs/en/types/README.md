# Encryption Types

## Symmetric encryption
Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext. Both parties are required to have access to the secret key, so this is one of the main drawbacks of symmetric key encryption.

## Asymmetric encryption
Asymmetric cryptography (or public-key cryptography) is any cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. 

This accomplishes two functions: authentication, where the public key verifies that a holder of the paired private key sent the message, and encryption, where only the paired private key holder can decrypt the message encrypted with the public key.
