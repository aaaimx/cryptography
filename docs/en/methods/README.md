# Encryption Method

An encryption method is essentially made up of two elements, a _cryptographic algorithm_ and one or more _secret keys_. While the algorithm describes the encryption method (eg, "Shifts each letter through the alphabet sequence"), the key provides the parameter ("C = three positions"). This is what enables encryption to be defined as a procedure by which clear text and a key are delivered to the cryptographic algorithm and an encrypted text is obtained.

Choosing an encryption method is always an important decision and the different methods should be analyzed before making it. The PCI standard maintains a list of recommended methods that is updated as new ones are recommended.

Among those known are:

- Caesar Cipher
- Vigen√®re Cipher
- Hashing
